create me a readme.md file for this project made in flutter. It allows users to search up the value of any stock on the stock market using their symbol (ex: AMZN for amazon). The users can curate their own list of stocks to track, and they can reorder, add, remove, or clear items from this list at any time. The list of curated stocks is stored locally on the user's device.
